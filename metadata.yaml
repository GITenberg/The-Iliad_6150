description: One of the foremost achievements in Western literature, Homer's Iliad
  tells the story of the darkest episode in the Trojan War. At its centre is Achilles,
  the greatest warrior-champion of the Greeks, and his refusal to fight after being
  humiliated by his leader Agamemnon. But when the Trojan Hector kills Achilles' close
  friend Patroclus, he storms back into battle to take revenge - although knowing
  this will ensure his won early death. Interwoven with this tragic sequence of events
  are powerfully moving descriptions of the ebb and flow of battle, of the domestic
  world inside Troy's besieged city of llium and of the conflicts between the gods
  on Olympus as they argue over the fate of mortals.-Back cover.
